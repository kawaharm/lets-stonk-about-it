# Let's Stonk About It

## Description
Ever thought about how posting messages on social media can impact the stock market?  *Let's Stonk About It*  is a web-based platform that examines the emotional elements of company-related tweets and compares it with its stock price in real-time. 

*** As of March 2023, Twitter API has discontinued access to retrieving tweets from its Free tier. Therefore, I am in the process of finding an alternative resource for sentiment analysis. Stay tuned!! ***

## Inspiration
On January 26, 2021, Elon Musk tweeted "Gamestonk!!" in reference to the "wallstreetbets" Reddit page that was behind the unprecedented rise of Gamestop's stock price against the attempt of opposing short-sellers. This caused shares to go as high as 157% the following day ([Reference](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-elon-musk-gamestonk-tweet-extends-trading-rally-2021-1-1030009065)). In awe by how this one tweet shook the trading landscape, I was interested to see if there was a correlation between the Twitterverse's opinions on a company and its stock performance.
