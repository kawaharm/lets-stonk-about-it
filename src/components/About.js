          On January 26, 2021, Elon Musk tweeted "Gamestonk!!" in reference to
          the "wallstreetbets" Reddit page that was behind the unprecedented
          rise of Gamestop's stock price against the attempt of opposing
          short-sellers. This caused shares to go as high as 157% the following
          day (
          <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-elon-musk-gamestonk-tweet-extends-trading-rally-2021-1-1030009065">

          ). In awe by how this one tweet shook the trading landscape, I was
          interested to see if there was a correlation between the
          Twitterverse's opinions on a company and its stock performance.
